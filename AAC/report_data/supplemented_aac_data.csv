On October 21, JM (40) attempted a rappel from the top of the climb Honey Pot (5.5), located in the Three Bears area. As she rappelled, one end of the rope passed through her device and she fell approximately 30 feet, hitting a ledge, and then fell to the ground, striking her head. Climbers with medical training were on the scene immediately and were able to perform basic first aid. EMTs arrived on site approximately 30 minutes later. She was conscious immediately after the fall. She had a large head laceration, four missing teeth and two fractured neck vertebrae. She was not wearing a helmet.

Multiple witnesses noted seeing JM at the top of the rock face and saw her throw her rope down to rappel. They also reported noticing that the doubled rope was uneven and that one end did not reach the ground but extended only about 10 feet down from the anchors. All witnesses stated that the time between noticing her rope being uneven and when she began the rappel was only a matter of seconds and that no one could stop her before she came to the short end of the rope and it passed through her device.

ANALYSIS

The climber failed to ensure both ends of the rope were on the ground before beginning to rappel. She also did not tie stopper knots on the rope ends. She had been told by her partner earlier in the day not to set up an anchor unless someone else was there to observe. Another witness watched her set up a top anchor earlier in the day, and although it was set up correctly, the witness said she displayed a lack of safety awareness as she worked at the top of the rock face.

Its apparent that JM rushed the rappel setup and moved quickly onto the ropes. For critical transitions like going on a rappel, take an extra moment to verify everything is correct. In addition, if JM had yelled Rope! or On rappel! to the climbers below before starting down, this might have given them additional opportunity to warn her. Experienced climbers need to speak up immediately when they observe a technique or behavior that puts a climber in imminent danger.

Late in the afternoon on April 16, a male climber (28) was injured after falling approximately 20 feet to the ground in the Moores Wall Amphitheater while being lowered from the route Quaker State (5.11a). The belayers end of the rope slipped through the belay device before the climber reached the ground, precipitating thefall. The patient was conscious when EMS arrived and complained of head pain. Upon arriving at the hospital, the climber was diagnosed with a fractured temporal bone and cerebral hemorrhage in the back of his head. He was not wearing a helmet.

ANALYSIS

This route is about 100 feet high, so lowering with a 60-meter (197-foot) rope would provide no margin for error. Although the precise circumstances are not known, ropes shrink with age, making it possible the climbers rope was shorter than believed. Its also possible that the method the climber used to thread the anchors for lowering used up significant amounts of rope.

This type of incident continues to be a problem at climbing areas across the country. These accidents can be prevented by closing the belay system, which can be done by: (1) Both climber and belayer tying into the rope; (2) Placing a stopper knot on the end of the rope; and/or (3) Tying the belayers end of the rope to an anchor or rope bag. And, always wear a helmet. (Source: The Editors.)",Climbing,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106346381/quaker-state,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,M

On October 14, I started leading the direct start to Ventre de Boeuf, which begins with an easy squeeze chimney leading to a short 5.10 offwidth. Because of the chimney start, my first piece of pro was a number 4 Camalot maybe 20 feet off the deck. I tried working the offwidth move for a bit, but ultimately found it to be a little too slimy and hard. The regular 5.9 start avoids this offwidth by climbing up a thin crack maybe 12 feet to the right. Because I didnt want to yard on the cam to bypass the OW section (as it was my only pro), and not wanting to take a pendulum swing if I fell off the line to the right, I removed the cam, downclimbed a bit, andthen started traversing up and to the right to join the regular start.

I found only two marginal pieces of pro: a small offset nut and then a sort of upward-facing number 0.1 (red) Black Diamond X4 cam. These pieces were about 1.5 feet apart from one another. As I was making a move maybe two feet from where I could reach with my left hand to the crack above the offwidth, my foot blew, along with the two small pieces of pro. I instinctively kicked out from the wall when the cam blew, and I think that zippered out my nut.

I fell about 16 to 18 feet and briefly landed upright on my feet, but most of the impact was absorbed on my right butt and right hand. I was wearing a helmet and didnt hit my head. I suffered two compression fractures (L1 and L2) and a good deal of trauma to my lower abs and pelvic area (although thankfully didnt break my pelvis), and I needed a few stitches in my right palm.

ANALYSIS

In retrospect, I should have kept the big cam in. I would have pendulumed into the corner if I fell, but this likely would have been much better than hitting the ground. I hate placing nuts as the first pro, but the pickings were slim. (Source: Daniel Negless.)",Climbing,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105814941/ventre-de-boeuf,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,m
