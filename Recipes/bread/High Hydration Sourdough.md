# Ingredients #

* 300g white flour (mix in gluten as needed to up protein content)
* 255g water
* 1 tbsp starter
* 1 tsp salt


# Method #

1. Mix 60g white flour with 51g water and 1 tbsp starter. Mix/knead until mostly smooth, then fold every ~30 minutes to strengthen biga. Continue as the biga ferments and rises until approximately doubled.
2. Mix 180g water with 153g water and mix/knead until mostly smooth. Allow dough to autolyse, but optionally continue to work dough as wanted to develop structure.
3. Mix biga with another 60g white flour with 51g water. Mix, knead, and fold as before until biga has approximately doubled again.
4. Mix biga, dough, and 1 tsp salt. Knead until smooth and continue to fold every ~30 minutes for a couple hours. Let rise until approximately doubled.
5. Shape loaf and put in banneton. Let rise until underproofed by a couple hours (may not need to let rise at all), then proof in refrigerator overnight.
6. Bake covered at 450F for 20 minutes and uncovered for another 20-30 minutes.
