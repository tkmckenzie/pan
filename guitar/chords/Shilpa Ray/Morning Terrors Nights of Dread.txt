  Morning terrors and my nights of dread
C                Am
  Morning terror nights of dread
C                       Am
  I saw my soul stapled to my bed
C                          Am
  She saw her soul stapled to her bed
              Dm
It's weighing down on me
              C
It's weighing down on me
        Dm
Lock my head between my knees
        Am
I can't breathe

C                        Am
  Pacing round the ashes on my floor
C                              Am
  Sometimes I wish I could fly out of my window
         Dm
Weighing down me
              C
It's weighing down on me
     Dm
Cold sweats through my arteries
        Am
I can't breathe

               Dm
No one gets it easy
             C
She wants it easy
               Dm
No one gets it easy
             C
She wants it easy

         Dm
I need a 60ft yacht, some trust fund kids
    Am
The promise of a woman in white bikini
   Dm
Prescription drugs, prescription love
        Am
And the miracle to clean up all my dirty martinis

          Dm
I want it easy
             C
She wants it easy
          Dm
I want it easy
             C
She wants it easy

        Dm                            Am
I wanna fit in the picture of someone else's dream

C                         Am
  Morning terrors and the nights of dread
C                     Am
  Morning terrors her nights of dread
C                            Am
  I get the kind of sun made out of lead
C                            Am
  She gets the kind sun made out of lead
              Dm
It's weighing down on me
              C
It's weighing down on me
Dm
